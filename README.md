# Compositional Layouts

Example of collection view using a diffable data source and compositional layout.

<p align="center">
	<img src="./screenshots/header.jpg" width="45%">
	<img src="./screenshots/allcells.jpg" width="45%">
</p>

## Open issues

Trying to use auto-layout for the headers, there is something wrong when changing the dynamic types' configuration.

## Disclaimers

The purpose of this project was only to put in practice collection view compositional layout: sections, groups, items, and the needed fractional calculations.
